							<h3>About Me</h3>
						<p><img src="images/me.jpg" alt="my image">
						I was born in rural Ireland and grew up in a town called Thurles in Co. Tipperary. I completed my Leaving Cert in 1998 and started 
						to work as a garage hand/mechanic for a number of years. I got involved in maintainence and
						car restoration, it was a fantastic job but as the times passed by the need to earn more and 
						and succeed in differant area's was a priority.<br><br>
						I started working as a semi-skilled operetive/Chef for a local factory called Dawn Fresh Foods
						where i worked for 7 years. Unfortunatly that job came to an end in 2011 with a large loss of jobs
						in the area.<br><br>
						I moved to Dublin and started working for Kylemore Services Group as a commis chef, where i was positioned in 
						the resturant in o Connell Street for 2 years. But as economic times got worse so did the employment in the 
						country. This job also got <em>"knocked on the head"</em> so it was time to think about up-skilling for a new career.<br><br>
						I then got the oppertunity to go back to college, i started a <strong>Fetac Level 5 Business Adminstration IT and Design</strong>						and 
						from there i went on to do <strong> Fetac level 6 Business Management</strong>. I am now studying for a 
						<strong>Creative Digital Media Degree</strong> at the IT 
						Blanchardstown.
